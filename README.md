# Tech Stocks Performance & Risk Analysis (2018-2026)

An in-depth data analysis project exploring the growth, volatility, and correlations of three major tech giants: **Apple (AAPL)**, **Microsoft (MSFT)**, and **Tesla (TSLA)**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to evaluate investment efficiency by comparing historical returns against market risks. The analysis covers a significant period, including the global shocks of 2020 and the market correction of 2025.

## Key Insights

* **Maximum Growth:** **Tesla (TSLA)** emerged as the absolute leader with a staggering **1823.89%** total growth.
* **Risk Assessment:** While Tesla offered the highest rewards, it also carried the most risk with a **4.00% average daily volatility**—twice as much as Apple or Microsoft.
* **Market Stability:** **Microsoft (MSFT)** and **Apple (AAPL)** demonstrated high correlation and served as "Safe Havens," providing steady growth (400-580%) with lower daily fluctuations (under 2%).
* **Systemic Correction:** The analysis confirms a synchronized market downturn in **2025**, where correlations spiked, affecting all three assets simultaneously.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Advanced data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis.

## Visualizations Included
1. **Cumulative Returns:** Comparison of a $1 investment growth.
2. **Volatility Analysis:** Time-series of daily returns and Boxplots to identify outliers.
3. **Correlation Matrix:** Heatmap showing how these stocks move in tandem.

## Conclusion
The study proves the classic "High Risk, High Reward" rule. While Tesla is ideal for aggressive growth, a combination of Microsoft and Apple provides a more balanced and resilient portfolio against market shocks like the one seen in 2025.
